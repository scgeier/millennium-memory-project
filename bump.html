   <h2>The Reminiscence Bump</h2>
   <p class="article-text">Studies show that people are more likely to remember events if they occurred during their teens and 20s.  This phenomenon is known as the “reminiscence bump,” and it appears not only in people’s memories of events, but also in the content of their dreams, their musical tastes, and their preferences for movies and books.<br><br>The night of December 31, 1999, however, was a seemingly unique event. The turn of the millennium happened to everyone, everywhere, and people of all generations had a stake in the moment; if our computers crashed because of the Y2K Bug, we would have all felt the effects. You might think that if any memory could transcend the reminiscence bump, it would be that one.</p>

   <p class="article-text">However, as this scatterplot diagram shows, this was not the case.
   <img id="computer-guy" src="img/computer-guy.svg" style="width:40%; float:right;" />Seventy-nine percent of survey respondents who were in their teens or 20s at the turn of the millennium have flashbulb memories of that night, compared to only 59 percent of people from other age groups. These “reminiscence bumpers” are now in their 30s and 40s; their memory scores are clustered at the top of the diagram.<br><br>Hover over the dots to read the individual stories and get an even better sense of the dichotomy. The memories clustered at the top are mostly paragraphs, full of details like the color of a dress, or the name of a boy who was standing nearby at midnight. The dots to the bottom and right of the chart bring up single sentences with vague memories, or no memories at all.</p>
