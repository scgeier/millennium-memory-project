   <p class="article-text"><span id="big-letter">D</span><span id="lead">ecember 31, 1999 was a strange day in American history.</span></br></br>Before jumping to the obvious reason why, you have to remember the context. Bill Clinton was President, having survived impeachment a few months earlier. Fox News and MSNBC had just arrived on the cable television scene; the relatively few people who watched those channels at the time did so on boxes that weighed 200 pounds and projected images through a vacuum tube.</br></br>America was in the midst of one of the biggest economic booms in history. The main cause of that boom – the Internet – was still relatively new. It greeted most people each day with blinking prompt on a desktop screen and the screech of a dial-up modem. But it was changing fast. Millions of recent college graduates were taking jobs that didn’t even exist when they were freshmen.  “Dot com” was the phrase on everyone’s lips on December 31, 1999. “Bubble” was not.</br></br>Buried in the trillions of lines of code that made it all possible, were two little numbers – nine and nine. Those numbers were about roll over to zeroes and cause planes to fall from the sky, if some of the experts were to be believed.  Others weren’t worried about a computer bug as much as a real eschatological endgame: the Apocalypse. The Second Coming.</br></br> All of this fervor reached its peak on December 31, 1999, because, of course, it was the night before the new millennium. Except that it wasn’t. Technically speaking, the new millennium wouldn’t happen for another year.</br></br>Most Americans either didn’t notice the millennial fine print or they didn’t care. <img id="computer-guy" src="img/computer-guy.svg"/>The rollover to this weird new date – 2000! -- was the real cause for celebration. It <em>felt</em> like the start of the new millennium, and many people were going to party just like Prince said they would.</br></br>And then midnight came, and midnight went.  And of all the peculiar things about the event, perhaps the strangest thing is this: in the 16 years since, hardly anyone has talked about it.</br></br>This project – my master’s thesis at the University of North Carolina – was my attempt to start the conversation. In the summer of 2016, I reached out to more than 200 people in a nationwide online survey, asking them about New Year’s Eve, 1999. I wanted to know if that night became a flashbulb memory, a memory in which they remembered exactly where they were and what they were doing. Most flashbulb memories come from unexpected tragedies, like September 11th or the Kennedy assassination. New Year’s 1999 was a planned, ostensibly happy occasion. It was a once-in-a-lifetime event (once in many lifetimes, actually), but nothing horrible happened. Would many people still remember it? If so, what would they remember doing? Who did they spend that moment with? Why?</br></br>My plan, at first, was to just crunch the numbers from the survey, visualize the data, and produce a piece of data journalism. But I quickly realized that I needed to do more than just get the data. The numbers might tell a story – the big picture story of patterns and projections – but they don’t tell <em>stories</em>. Numbers don’t laugh. They don’t sigh with nostalgia when talking about what it used to be like to develop a roll of film. This project is a time capsule about a peculiar moment in our lives. You don’t stuff a time capsule with pie charts. You need to let the people tell the stories themselves, in their own words.</br></br>So after I ran the survey, I grabbed a microphone.
